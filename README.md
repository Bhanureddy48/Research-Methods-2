This code in repository performs English-to-French sentence translation using a fine-tuned T5 model. It includes data preprocessing, tokenization, training with Hugging Face's Trainer, and evaluation using BLEU, ROUGE, METEOR, and chrF++ metrics. The dataset is cleaned and prepared for neural machine translation. The model is trained on a sample dataset and evaluated on 200 random examples. All code is written in Python and runs on Google Colab with Hugging Face Transformers and Datasets.
